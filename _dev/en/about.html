      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <div class="text">
        <p>The framework of this blog site is Hexo, and the theme is Butterfly. It mainly records my computer-related study notes. I will write articles from time to time. It is inclusive, all-encompassing, unlimited topics, just for fun, and I will also share my experience and record my life. The bit by bit, every moment of thought, if you can inadvertently help your friends and make you feel happy and relaxed, all the effort is worth it. Look at it, you can visit this site in the corner of the vast Internet, which makes me feel very lucky~</p>
        <p>As the saying goes, a good memory is not as good as a bad pen. Moreover, my memory is not good, and I want to leave something valuable in the next life. This may be my original intention to build a blog. In my opinion, a blog is like a notebook or a diary that records your thoughts and thoughts. It is also like a teacher, a senior or a senior sister giving you advice, or even a time machine to take. You appreciate the wonderful moments of the journey, it can be everything; archives are more like a mirror of the blogger, which can be called "the villa of the soul", pages with different functions reflect the different sides of the blogger's heart, without having to face the blogger. You can understand Ta like an old friend by talking in the ground, maybe, this is the charm of blogging.</p>
